# python-api-challenge
Background
Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?

Before You Begin
Create a new repository for this project called python-api-challenge. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.

Clone the new repository to your computer.

Inside your local Git repository, create a directory for this assignment. Use a folder name that corresponds to the Challenges, such as WeatherPy.

Inside the folder you just created, add the files called api_keys.py, WeatherPy.ipynb, and VacationPy.ipynb that you will find in the starter code ZIP file provided. These will be the main scripts to run for each analysis.

Before you push your changes to GitHub, add a .gitignore file.

Add a .gitignore File
For this assignment, you will need to add a .gitignore file to your repo. Doing so will prevent the api_keys.py file that contains your API key from being shared with the public. If you skip this step, anyone using GitHub could copy and use your API key, and you may incur charges as a result.

To get started, type git status in the command line to see a list of all the untracked files that you have created so far.

To add only the WeatherPy.ipynb file to GitHub, for example, type git add WeatherPy.ipynb. Keep in mind that you would have to add each file individually when adding or updating a file. A more efficient solution is to add all of the files that you don't want to track to the .gitignore file.

Before adding your files to GitHub, add api_keys.py to the .gitignore file by following these steps:

Open your python-api-challenge GitHub folder in VS Code.

Open the .gitignore file and type the following code on the first line:

# Adding config.py file.
api_keys.py
In the command line, type git status and press Enter. The output should indicate that the .gitignore file has been modified and the api_keys.py file is untracked.
